# Implied-Volatility-Surface

A volatility surface plots the level of implied volatility in 3D space. The days to expiration are on the X-axis, the strike price is on the Y-axis, and implied volatility is on the Z-axis.
Implied volatility is the marketâ€™s expectations of volatility over the life of an option. 
Pricing models assume volatility is the same for all strike prices and maturities. Volatility surfaces show this assumption is not true.
